# About #

This plug-in automatically hides the eclipse toolbar on start up.

It is surprising there is no way to turn the eclipse toolbar off permanently. In 3.2 they added the "Hide Toolbar" option on right click, but the toolbar creeps right back in on a restart. I have personally never found much uses of the toolbar and I'd like more screen space.

This plug-in automatically hides the toolbar on start up. Basically just emulates clicking "Hide Toolbar" for you.

# Installation #

_(It looks like my update site doesn't work well with Galileo. In the mean time, please use the the [plain old jar](http://eclipse-hide-toolbar.googlecode.com/files/com.kizzx2.hidetoolbar_1.0.1.jar) as a drop-in)_

# Thanks #
[eclipse-fullscreen](http://code.google.com/p/eclipse-fullscreen/) for inspiration. That is a great plug-in. Sometimes we just want to hide the toolbar but retain other views (i.e. not fullscreen); that is where eclipse-hide-toolbar comes in to play.

# Help Wanted #
I have only learned about eclipse plug-ins a couple of days before rolling out this plug-in, which isn't perfect (see [issue #3](http://code.google.com/p/eclipse-hide-toolbar/issues/detail?id=3)). If you know of a better way to hide the Toolbar, please be sure to let me know! Just a pointer or two and I'll implement it!
